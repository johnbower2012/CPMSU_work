Each file in the subfolder 'bm' is an output generated for the specified n and file type.

To execute a file properly, enter on the same line:

	_grid_point_count_(as int)_ 
	_desired_data/time_output_file_name_
	_1_or_0_for_'yes'_or_'no'_errorfile_
	_2_1_0_for_timefile_datafile_nofile_

For example,
"LUtime5000.dat" was generated with "./LUdecomp.x 5000 LUtime5000.dat 0 2"
"LU10.dat" was generated with "./LUdecomp.x 10 LU10.dat 0 1" 
"LUerror.dat" was generated with "./LUdecomp.x 1000 ANY 1 0"
"tridtime5e7.dat" was generated with "./tridiag.x 50000000 tridtime5e7.dat 0 2"
"trid10.dat" was generated with "./tridiag.x 10 trid10.dat 0 1"
"trid_error.dat" was generated with "./tridiag.x 10000000 ANY 1 0"

Both error and time/data files can be generated at once, both using the entry for n:

"./LUdecomp.x 1000 time_file 1 2" will output both an error and time file using n=1000.
"./tridiag.x 1000 data_file 1 1" will output both an error and data file using n=1000.

Data and time files cannot be generated at once, since they both rely on the same loop.
